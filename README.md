# REtimed-and-Original-JPSubtitles
I'm currently learning Japanese. Therefore I've downloaded my share of jp subs. Sadly I've noticed that a lot of them are mistimed. This repository is for all the subtitles that I've retimed myself. If someone notices a mistake in my subtitles, corrections are welcome. Please open up a github issue, I'll take a look at it.

## TODO List
There are some shows that don't have accurate JPSubs. (Mainly foreign content dubbed into Japanese.) I've been thinking of subtitling those movies/shows myself and uploading those content accurate subs here. Though in that case I'd need someone to correct my subs.
